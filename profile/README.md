# Open Yautja

OpenYautja project aims to create costume inspired by Yautja/Predator ( [Predator (1987)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093773/) and [Predator 2 (1990)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100403/) ).

The "Open" part of the name means that anyone can contribute and use it.
The goal is for everyone to have compatible hardware and software but personalized to their liking - you can swap Plasmacasters and it should still work.
Not everything may fit (like Head/Biomask having different shape) but consider those something like shoes - they work the same say but fit different people.
